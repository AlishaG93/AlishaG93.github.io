        <p>My name is Alisha Gapas. I attend Weber State University and my major is Computer Science. I live Layton and 
            I've been living here for about 10 years. My father was in the military (Air Force) so we 
            traveled a lot and his last assignment was here in Utah. I have one brother, his 
            name is Michael and one cat named Momo. 
            I work as a CNA in a tranistional Rehab center and have been working in healthcare for about 8 years.
            My hobbies include playing and listening to music. I self-taught how to play guitar, drums, bass, piano, ukulele.
            I like attending shows/concerts and hanging out with my friends.
            I usually play a lot of video games mostly Playstation and PC. I have too many hobbies.
